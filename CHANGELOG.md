## [Unreleased]

## [0.4.0] - 2026-06-19

### Added
- **In-app LLM provider system (#77).** The Claude chat is now provider-agnostic:
  a main-process registry adds **OpenAI, Google Gemini, Grok (xAI) and GitHub
  Copilot** alongside Anthropic Claude, surfaced as provider / model / effort
  dropdowns at the bottom of the chat with secure per-provider API-key storage.
  Only Anthropic is verified locally; the others are wired to spec and untested
  without credentials.
- **Send console output to chat (#78).** A **Send to chat** button above the
  console (shown when the chat panel is open) plus an **Attach console (since
  last Run)** composer toggle hand the device's REPL output to the assistant
  without copy-paste.
- **AI-first editor (#82).** The chat always sees the up-to-date active file;
  assistant code blocks gain an **Apply** button that writes straight into the
  editor (undoable); and an opt-in **inline autocomplete** (ghost text) suggests
  as you type via a fast, per-provider completion model configured separately
  from the main chat model.
- **GitHub Copilot via a personal access token.** The Copilot provider exchanges
  a GitHub PAT / OAuth token (on a Copilot-enabled account) for the short-lived
  Copilot token its chat endpoint requires, caching it until just before expiry.
  Experimental — verifiable only against a real Copilot account.
- **Editor paper settings (#80, #81).** A new **Settings** dialog (toolbar gear)
  toggles the notebook **ruled lines**, a subtle squared **dots** grid, or
  **off**, and adjusts the **line spacing** (shown live) — persisted across
  launches.
- **macOS code signing + notarization** wired into the release workflow (#47).
  When the Apple secrets are set (`MAC_CSC_LINK`, `MAC_CSC_KEY_PASSWORD`,
  `APPLE_ID`, `APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD`, `APPLE_TEAM_ID` — see
  `docs/macos-signing.md`), releases are signed (Developer ID, hardened runtime
  + entitlements) and notarized — which is what lets the **in-app updater
  install on macOS** and removes the "damaged" Gatekeeper warning. Builds stay
  unsigned-but-working when the secrets are absent.

### Changed
- **Skeuomorph skin is the new default look.** A photoreal brushed-metal /
  green-felt / cream **ruled-paper** theme: a segmented New/Open/Save control,
  glossy Run/Stop pills, round panel-collapse knobs, a recessed green-phosphor
  console, and a notebook editor whose text sits on ruled lines (transparent
  Monaco over a ruled gradient, with a red margin rule). The toolbar knob flips
  to a dark "lights out" theme.
- **Removed the redundant panel title bars** for Editor, Source Control, Files,
  Packages, Plugins and Inspect (#79) — the activity bar already names the active
  view (Shell and Chat keep their headers, which carry controls).

## [0.3.3] - 2026-06-02

### Fixed
- **macOS auto-update (cont.):** the v0.3.2 mac `.zip` was built but not uploaded
  to the release (the CI artifact glob matched `*.blockmap` but not `*.zip`), so
  `latest-mac.yml` referenced a missing file. Upload `dist/*.zip` too.

## [0.3.2] - 2026-06-02

### Fixed
- **macOS auto-update** failed with "ZIP file not provided" — electron-updater
  on macOS downloads a `.zip`, but the mac target only built a `.dmg`. Added a
  `zip` mac target so `latest-mac.yml` references an updatable artifact. (Note:
  the *install* step still needs a signed app on macOS — see #47.)

## [0.3.1] - 2026-06-02

### Added
- Publish a **Linux arm64 AppImage** (built natively), so Raspberry Pi / arm64
  installs can receive in-app updates (#74). (Patch release.)

## [0.3.0] - 2026-06-02

### Added
- **Update notifications + status-bar update button (#74).** When a newer
  release is available the status bar shows an **Update to vX** button (in the
  version slot) — click to **download**, watch progress, then **Restart to
  update** (electron-updater, `autoDownload` off so it's user-initiated); a
  dismissible banner also offers Download. Adds `window.api.updates.download()`
  and an hourly re-check.
- **Python plugin system (MVP, #61).** Snakie spawns the user's `python3` running
  a host that discovers and loads Python plugins and talks to the app over
  JSON-RPC. Plugins use a stdlib-only `snakie` SDK (`@plugin.command`, `Context`,
  `message`/`edit` helpers); discovery from `~/.snakie/plugins/` (+ bundled
  examples and entry points). New **Plugins** activity-bar view lists plugins and
  runs their commands against the active file; graceful "Python not found" state.
  Ships an example plugin + `docs/writing-plugins.md` (design: `docs/plugin-system.md`).
- **Reactive plugins + editor decorations (#69).** Plugins can register a
  `@plugin.linter` that runs automatically as you type (debounced) and on open,
  drawing **squiggle underlines** (Monaco markers) and offering **lightbulb
  quick-fixes** (a Monaco code-action provider applies the plugin's edit). Adds a
  `lint` RPC / `window.api.plugins.lint`, diagnostics with optional ranged
  `fixes`, and an example linter (flags trailing whitespace + TODOs).
- **Python linter plugin (#65).** A bundled `python_linter` plugin runs **ruff**
  (with autofix quick-fixes) or falls back to **pyflakes**, linting `.py` files
  live via the reactive engine. New **Problems** tab in the shell panel (count
  badge, click-to-jump) backed by a shared diagnostics store, and a persisted
  **Lint on/off** toggle. Graceful when no linter is installed (`pip install ruff`).
- **Toolbar file actions:** New File, Open Folder and Save icon buttons (left of
  Run). Save also works via Ctrl/Cmd-S, with a native **Save As** dialog for
  untitled buffers. The opened folder is now the app's shared working directory,
  so both the toolbar and the Files panel drive it.

### Fixed
- **Source Control now follows the open working folder.** It was always showing
  "Open a folder to manage it with Git" even after a folder was chosen in Files;
  it now points the Git service at the shared `currentFolder` (auto `openRepo` +
  status) and its "Open Folder" buttons drive the same shared action.
- **File operations did nothing in Electron.** New File / New Folder / Rename
  (in both file trees) and the "Upload to board" path used `window.prompt`,
  which Electron's renderer doesn't implement — replaced with an in-app prompt
  modal so they work.
- **Critical: `window.api` preload bridge never loaded in the real Electron
  app** (only the browser preview "worked"), so Open Folder, package search, the
  serial port list and all device features did nothing. Two causes, both fixed:
  the preload was emitted as `index.js` but `package.json` is `"type": "module"`,
  so Electron's `require()` failed with `ERR_REQUIRE_ESM` — now emitted/loaded as
  `index.cjs`; and `sandbox: true` blocked the CommonJS preload from
  `require()`-ing `@electron-toolkit/preload` — now `sandbox: false`
  (`contextIsolation` + `nodeIntegration: false` kept). The renderer fallback
  also now logs a loud error if the bridge is missing inside Electron rather than
  silently masking it.
- **Editor matched the app theme:** the Monaco editor no longer shows a light
  background in dark mode. It reads the app's `data-theme` (via a MutationObserver,
  so it can't desync) and uses a custom dark theme whose background matches the
  NES palette (`#14141f`).
- Removed the duplicated "Device files" heading in the device panel's
  empty state (the section header already names it).

### Changed
- **Retro 8-bit UI overhaul.** New look & feel: NES-inspired dark theme
  (slate + blue/red/green/yellow accents), a single readable **JetBrains Mono**
  font across the whole UI, square corners and chunky pixel buttons — the 8-bit
  feel comes from the palette/buttons/borders, not the font. Dark is the default.
- **Left activity bar + view switching.** A vertical icon strip on the far
  left switches the left sidebar between **Files**, **Source Control**,
  **Packages**, **Inspect** (Outline + Variables in a vertical split), and
  **Help**. Source Control / Packages / Outline / Variables / Help moved out of
  the right pane. The center editor is unchanged.
- **Right pane is now Chat-only**; the toolbar toggle is relabelled
  "Panel" → "Chat". Toolbar Run/Stop/Flash and the shell Clear button are
  sized consistently with the other toolbar buttons.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-01

### Added
- Drafted a placeholder Snakie app logo — a snake coiled into an "S" on a green
  squircle (`build/icon.png`, editable source `build/icon.svg`). (#46)
- Build target added: macOS Intel (x64) dmg, alongside the existing macOS
  arm64, Linux x64 and Windows x64 installers. (#49) (Linux arm64 was attempted
  but deferred — see #53 — due to electron-builder's x86 `fpm`/`-m64` issues.)
- Unit tests (vitest) for the pure parsing logic — code outline, device
  variables, and serial-plotter line parsing (39 tests); `npm test` and a CI
  test step. Plus `docs/hardware-test-plan.md`, a manual on-device checklist.
  (toward #45)

### Changed
- Renderer startup payload cut ~88% (~7.4 MB → ~0.9 MB): Monaco is now
  code-split and lazy-loaded only when a file is opened, and the unused JSON
  language service was dropped (`.json` opens as plain text). (#48)

### Fixed
- Renderer no longer blank-screens when the Electron preload bridge
  (`window.api` / `window.electron`) is unavailable — e.g. a browser preview or
  a failed preload. A no-op fallback bridge is installed before render so the UI
  degrades gracefully to a "disconnected / empty" state (with a console
  warning). No effect inside Electron, where the real bridge is present.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-01

First public build — a cross-platform (Windows / macOS / Linux) Electron
MicroPython editor.

### Added
- **Editor:** Monaco editor with Python syntax, MicroPython-aware autocomplete,
  tabbed multi-file editing (with a `+` new-tab button), and Ctrl/Cmd-S save.
- **Files:** local and on-device file browsers with right-click context menus;
  create / rename / delete on both; upload-to-board / download-to-computer
  controls between the panes.
- **Device:** serial connection layer speaking the MicroPython raw-REPL
  protocol; interactive xterm REPL with connect / port-select / status; Run,
  Stop and Clear-shell controls; a serial plotter for numeric console output.
- **Right pane (tabbed):** in-app Help & MicroPython reference, code Outline,
  device Variables inspector, Claude LLM chat, and a `mip`/PyPI package
  installer with discovery.
- **Tools:** in-app MicroPython firmware flashing (esptool for ESP, UF2 copy for
  RP2040); built-in Git source control (status / stage / commit / diff /
  branch / push / pull); update notifications via electron-updater.
- **Shell:** resizable, collapsible panels with a light/dark theme.
- **Packaging:** electron-builder installers (Windows NSIS, macOS dmg, Linux
  AppImage + deb) built and published to GitHub Releases by a tag-triggered CI
  workflow.

### Known limitations
- Device, serial, firmware and on-device package-install paths are
  build/type-verified but not yet validated against real hardware.
- The LLM chat requires an Anthropic API key; the package installer requires
  network access.
- Placeholder app icon; code signing not yet configured.
