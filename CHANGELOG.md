# Changelog

All notable changes to Snakie are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and this project
adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- **Retro 8-bit UI overhaul.** New look & feel: NES-inspired dark theme
  (slate + blue/red/green/yellow accents), **Press Start 2P** pixel font on the
  UI chrome (toolbar, activity bar, headers, buttons) with a crisp readable
  **JetBrains Mono** for content (editor, console, file trees, chat), square
  corners and chunky pixel buttons. Dark is now the default theme.
- **Left activity bar + view switching.** A vertical icon strip on the far
  left switches the left sidebar between **Files**, **Source Control**,
  **Packages**, **Inspect** (Outline + Variables in a vertical split), and
  **Help**. Source Control / Packages / Outline / Variables / Help moved out of
  the right pane. The center editor is unchanged.
- **Right pane is now Chat-only**; the toolbar toggle is relabelled
  "Panel" → "Chat".

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-01

### Added
- Drafted a placeholder Snakie app logo — a snake coiled into an "S" on a green
  squircle (`build/icon.png`, editable source `build/icon.svg`). (#46)
- Build target added: macOS Intel (x64) dmg, alongside the existing macOS
  arm64, Linux x64 and Windows x64 installers. (#49) (Linux arm64 was attempted
  but deferred — see #53 — due to electron-builder's x86 `fpm`/`-m64` issues.)
- Unit tests (vitest) for the pure parsing logic — code outline, device
  variables, and serial-plotter line parsing (39 tests); `npm test` and a CI
  test step. Plus `docs/hardware-test-plan.md`, a manual on-device checklist.
  (toward #45)

### Changed
- Renderer startup payload cut ~88% (~7.4 MB → ~0.9 MB): Monaco is now
  code-split and lazy-loaded only when a file is opened, and the unused JSON
  language service was dropped (`.json` opens as plain text). (#48)

### Fixed
- Renderer no longer blank-screens when the Electron preload bridge
  (`window.api` / `window.electron`) is unavailable — e.g. a browser preview or
  a failed preload. A no-op fallback bridge is installed before render so the UI
  degrades gracefully to a "disconnected / empty" state (with a console
  warning). No effect inside Electron, where the real bridge is present.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-01

First public build — a cross-platform (Windows / macOS / Linux) Electron
MicroPython editor.

### Added
- **Editor:** Monaco editor with Python syntax, MicroPython-aware autocomplete,
  tabbed multi-file editing (with a `+` new-tab button), and Ctrl/Cmd-S save.
- **Files:** local and on-device file browsers with right-click context menus;
  create / rename / delete on both; upload-to-board / download-to-computer
  controls between the panes.
- **Device:** serial connection layer speaking the MicroPython raw-REPL
  protocol; interactive xterm REPL with connect / port-select / status; Run,
  Stop and Clear-shell controls; a serial plotter for numeric console output.
- **Right pane (tabbed):** in-app Help & MicroPython reference, code Outline,
  device Variables inspector, Claude LLM chat, and a `mip`/PyPI package
  installer with discovery.
- **Tools:** in-app MicroPython firmware flashing (esptool for ESP, UF2 copy for
  RP2040); built-in Git source control (status / stage / commit / diff /
  branch / push / pull); update notifications via electron-updater.
- **Shell:** resizable, collapsible panels with a light/dark theme.
- **Packaging:** electron-builder installers (Windows NSIS, macOS dmg, Linux
  AppImage + deb) built and published to GitHub Releases by a tag-triggered CI
  workflow.

### Known limitations
- Device, serial, firmware and on-device package-install paths are
  build/type-verified but not yet validated against real hardware.
- The LLM chat requires an Anthropic API key; the package installer requires
  network access.
- Placeholder app icon; code signing not yet configured.
